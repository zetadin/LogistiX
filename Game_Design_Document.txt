Working title: LogisticX

Concept:
"Amatures train tactics. Professionals plan logistics."
Mine -> produce -> supply an active warfront.
Your desicions on what to provide where drive the choises of AI generals and determine how the front moves.

Genre: RTS

Target audience:
Teens, young adults

Selling point:
Focus on supply instead of tactics.

Player Experience:
POV: Strategic planner in charge of automated mines, factories, and delivery systems
Setting: Contested colony planet for two sides to fight over.
Emotions: Endorphine hits from finishing small supply missions that influence the strategic situation.
Rewards: Political clout points that can be spent on recources, components, or changing the AI general priorities.

AV style:
Audio: none ATM
Graphics: 2D, hex grid, flat colors for map (pale pastells);
monochromatic tokens for supply bases, factories, mines, supply columns, and front line unit headquarters.

Game Setting:
Two mega corporations are in an armed dispute over the mining rights to a particulatly rich planet.
As neither side wanted to back down, more and more security forces and mercenary companies were
funneled into the ground war. Eventually, the corps realised they could not supply all the forces
from off-world and a call went out for subcontractors to manufacture vehicles, weapons, fuel,
and even food locally. Many small outfits with naught but an autofab and elbow grease now
flock to the two banners. The danger pay is decent, the demand plentifull, and the stakes high.
Will you take the job and find your way to riches or ruin?

Monetization:
Freemium. Open-source & free base game initially supported with ad banners.
Later, optional paid subscriptions or permanet per-vehicle/weapon blueprints
granting access to expanded production options.
Avoid Pay to Win.

Platform:
Web, io style. JavaScript front end with a Django back end.
1 person team. About 6 months to first playble.

Core Loops:

Request  ->                      -> Build infrastructure -> Deliver
Mine     ->  Produce* -> Deliver -> Expand teritory -> Produce
                                 -> Find resources -> Mine
                                 -> Research tech -> Produce

On demand missions in requested places* -> Content for all players, changes AI objectives
* = Monetization point

Objectives & Progression:
- Place your first Factory (request resources/components, build weapons/vehicles)
- Make supply Trucks, deliver supplies to front or other players (earn points)
- Build Supply Depot for faster turn around times
- Upgrade your Factory
- Build Mine/Refinery/Salvage yard (produce own resources/components)
- Learn skills to increase productivity
- Build dedicated component factories (supply production of other players)
- Supply Special Operations: Scouting, Sabotage, Raids, Strategic Bombardment,
                             Ore Exploration, Bluprint Research
- Supply Defensive Projects: Fortification, Mining, AA/AT emplacemt, Radars
- Supply Infrastructure Construction: Roads, Railways, Coop Mega Mines/Refineries/Factories
- Make Recovery Vehicles (tow back damaged vehicles for repairs)
- Build Ammo/Artillery/Heavy Vehicle/Drone/Plane Factories and integrated supply chains
- Fulfill AI requests for specific vehicles for replacements
- Equip fresh Platoons/Batalions and send them to reinforce the front
- Push the Enemy back to their Spaceport and off the planet

Game Systems:
- Map generation
- Map rendering & scrolling
- Private Factory construction & expansion
- AI request generation
- Recon system
- AI combat resolution
- Attacks on Infrastructure
- Movement of the front
- Coop Megastructures
- Formation of new units
- Blueprint research

Interactivity:
- Feedback from completing supply missions by expanding options/causing AI actions/moving the front
- Social: gain political points from completing supply missions & spend them to requests things
from the other players or the Spaceport
- Player orders production and dispatches supply caravans to transport goods.
- Supply levels determine AI actions (attack/defence) and generation of Special Operations.
- Special Operations can distrupt enemy production, but need to be supplied in turn.
- When enemy morale is sufficiently weakened they will retreat and friendlied can advance to
occupy their hex.
